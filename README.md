# Accessibility: Code Refactor

In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

* NOTE: As a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that the given site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I view the source code and find semantic HTML elements.
* It's done when I view the structure of the HTML elements and find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* It's done when I view the image elements and find accessible alt attributes.
* It's done when I view the heading attributes
and they fall in sequential order.
* It's done when I view the title element and  find a concise, descriptive title.

## Hints

* Substitute the <div> tags with appropriate tags, and adjust the CSS file to acoomodate the new tags.
