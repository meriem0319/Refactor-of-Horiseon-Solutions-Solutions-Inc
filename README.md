In this Challenge, a marketing agency needs the Web Developer to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

* NOTE: The marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that their site is optimized for modern search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It's done when I view the source code and find semantic HTML elements.
* It's done when I view the structure of the HTML elements and find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* It's done when I view the image elements and find accessible alt attributes.
* It's done when I view the heading attributes
and they fall in sequential order.
* It's done when I view the title element and  find a concise, descriptive title.

## Fixing HTML and CSS files

* Substitute the overwhelming number of `<div>` tags with appropriate tags, and adjust the CSS file to acoomodate the new tags if/when needed.
* Consolidated a lot of the CSS classes and IDs into one class to limit redundant repeating of classes/IDs
